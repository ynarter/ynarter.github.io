## About Me


I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Inigo Incer](https://iincer.github.io/). My research sits at the crossroads of **convex optimization, machine learning, signal processing**, and **the compositional design and verification of complex engineering systems**. I am a proud member of the [Complex Engineering Systems Laboratory](https://ces.eecs.umich.edu/), where we develop rigorous theory and methodologies to design, verify, and analyze complex systems, applying tools from control, formal methods, AI, optimization, and more, with real-world applications in aerospace, autonomous vehicles, and synthetic biology.

Before Michigan, I earned my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). During my undergrad, I gained hands-on experience conducting research at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working on projects ranging from radar systems to neural network-based algorithms. A recent highlight of my work is a first-author [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=z4XS0Ie391) on a unified screening strategy for multiple diseases, which was accepted at the [**_International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)_ 2025**](https://icml.cc/). You can find more details about my academic background and research on my [Bio](./bio.html) and [Publications](./publications.html) pages.

My goal is to bridge rigorous mathematical tools with impactful real-world problems, designing methods that advance both theory and practical solutions. Please feel free to [reach out](./contacts.html) anytime!
