## About Me

I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Inigo Incer. My research focuses on **convex optimization**, **machine learning**, and their applications in **signal processing** and **healthcare**.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University, where I graduated as the top student in my class. I also conducted research at EPFL and METEKSAN Defense, working on radar systems and medical decision-making.
